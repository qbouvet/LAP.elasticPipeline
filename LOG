TODO	
	
	do a version of the ciruit with elastic components (simple version, no buffers everywhere)
			debug OPunit
			(test new register file)    (test join3)    (test new OP unit)    (test genericFork[5])  (test IFD)
			re-implement circuit 
	
	do a version of the circuit with elasticBuffers (complex version)
			pipeline OP unit - test OP unit 
			add elastic control signal sto register file
			change IFD to be combinatorial and double check changes on this one
	
	is DD unit ok ?
	analyse performance
	memory bypass		-> need antitokens to be useful
	discuss eager join to find error in the design
	
	think/read about antitoken channel issuse	
	implement the latch version of elasticBuffer for comparison
	debug the rest of the early evaluation multiplexer




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES  

	
	registerFile : can write once per clock -> as long as we use synchronous buffers, as if "always ready" ?
		
	delayChannel -> what to do with control signals of the delayed outputs ? don't allow them to stall ?
				is valid even necessary, since these buffers should pretty much move at every clock cycle ?
						
	join : is the (not p_valid) term necessary for the read signal ?
	
																			----------------------------

	in this circuit, the only benefit we get is from the early evaluation, otherwise, pipeline is never going to stall ?
		-> in THIS circuit. change the number of buffers on one of the functions, we'll stall but still have the ability 
			to have swapped the operations and keep a correct circuit	
	even with the early evaluation, it's never going to stall ? 
		-> it is. recall that elastic systems are meant to allow functions to be interchangeable. if you have 2 functions of 
			different length (with different number of buffers), then you'll have to stall at some point. 				
	quel interet d'utiliser des elastic buffers pour stocker/delayer l'adresse et l'opcode ? cf control signals : always ready
		-> for when we stall - cf join at the entrance of register file / possible stalling	
	is the dependency detection unit right ? heavily relies ont the fact that 1 instr/cycle comes from the IFD
		-> need to thange that	
	what is the elastic buffer between the write and read steps ?
		-> reminder that the register file needs to be elastic too	
	what happens if the enable signal stops the shifting, but there's an incomming antitoken 
		->  problem
