TODO	
	
	test join
	implement fork (2 architectures)
	
	think about possible antitoken channel issues	
	implement the latch version of elasticBuffer for comparison
	debug the rest of the early evaluation multiplexer





NOTES  
	
		what happens if the enable signal stops the shifting, but there's an incomming antitoken (can the situation happen ? case the other )
	
	is it a good idea to use not clk for the shift register of the antitoken channel ? -> no
		



DONE

	testbench the antitoken channel
	rework the antitoken channel architecture in regards to when the register stops shifting (based on data transiting instead of purely clock)
	testbench for the antitoken channel's shift register
	debugged antitoken channel's shift register
