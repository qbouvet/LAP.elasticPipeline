TODO	
	
	do dependence detection unit
	connect stuff altogether -> need dependance detection unit
	memory bypass		-> need antitokens
	discuss eager join to find error in the design
	
	think/read about antitoken channel issuse	
	implement the latch version of elasticBuffer for comparison
	debug the rest of the early evaluation multiplexer





NOTES  
	
	jon : is the (not p_valid) term necessary for the read signal ?
	what happens if the enable signal stops the shifting, but there's an incomming antitoken (can the situation happen ? case the other )
	
	is it a good idea to use not clk for the shift register of the antitoken channel ? -> no
		



DONE

	understand the eager fork
	implement fork 
	test join (lazy)
	testbench the antitoken channel
	rework the antitoken channel architecture in regards to when the register stops shifting (based on data transiting instead of purely clock)
	testbench for the antitoken channel's shift register
	debugged antitoken channel's shift register
